  Apache Camel is an open source integration framework that makes system integration very simple. Using an integrator we can focus more on how to interoperate with the system, rather than how the system we are integrating actually works internally. Apache Camel provides simplicity and manageable abstractions for complex systems, due to these characteristics Apache Camel is considered an excellent integration framework. In addition, Apache Camel makes integration into software projects very productive. Basically with little code we can do a lot of things that would need a lot of code, external libraries, internal control, etc.
